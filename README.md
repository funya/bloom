# Bloom

Bloom is a project in collaboration with API Chaya, a local nonprofit that serves survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and human trafficking.  It is a storytelling platform that allows survivors to convey their unique personal stories on our web application via different forms of media including text, images, and audio files.  Our project is designed to be simple for users who are not as “versed” in technology and who want to share their experiences with the public, or privately with service providers (namely API Chaya) to receive services.
