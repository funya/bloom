# Bloom

Bloom is a project in collaboration with API Chaya, a local nonprofit that serves survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and human trafficking. Bloom is a storytelling platform that allows anyone to convey their unique personal stories centered around the theme of sexual assault, domestic violence, and human trafficking, via different forms of media including text and images. Our project is designed to provide a simple platform for users who want to write their personal stories at their own pace and share their experiences with the public at any time.

# Features
- View other user's personal stories at the front page
- Shareable URL of stories that are public
- Create a private account to manage all personal stories created
- Create any amount of public or private stories
- Rearrange sections of your story
- Flexible edit UI that can be changed from "Grid Mode" to "List Mode"
- Input text or images for stories

# Build With
- DigitalOcean: Cloud hosting which provides Linux virtual servers
- MongoDB: NoSQL database program
- Redis: In-memory data structure store for caching
- React: Javascript library for building user interfaces
- Redux: State container management system
- Docker: Software container platform for deploying apps
- Go: Programming language used for API server

> We chose this technology stack for 3 main reasons: low cost, prior knowledge, and ease of use. We already had prior 
> exprience working with these technologies or learned them in previous classes and so it made sense to use them again to 
> make development relatively easier, considering the time frame we had. All the technologies we used besides DigitalOcean
> are open source and has a big community supporting it, whichs makes the source code more accessible. DigitalOcean, though 
> not free, is pretty easy to use with their expansive documentation and they offer a broad range of options of server
> hosting plans, with their lowest tier plan being 5 dollars a month. We chose to use a NoSQL database because our database
> schema changed quite often during development. A NoSQL made sense - it gave us the flexibility we needed.
